[Simple OAuth2](#simple-oauth2) is a Node.js client library for the [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) authorization framework. [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) is the industry-standard protocol for authorization, enabling third-party applications to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on it's own behalf.
